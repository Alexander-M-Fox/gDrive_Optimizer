# Welcome to gDrive Optimizer
This project was developed as a Software Engineering assignment at Bournemouth University. 
The gDrive optimizer is a web application meant to solve the problem of uploading large video files to google drive and running out of free storage. The app does this by compressing down the userâ€™s video and reuploading them back to their drive in a fully automated way that makes the whole process seamless from the point of view of the user.
